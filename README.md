# ReMovie
Sample exercise for building a movie ratings app in Laravel.

## Description
Let's build a movie review app. The app should have some basic features that allow a user to search for movies and see the ratings and reviews of the movie.

The features should include:

### Auth
A user should be able to register for the application and be able to sign in and out.

### Search
The app should allow the user to search for a movie, and see a list of movie results that match what the user searched. 

### Ratings
The user should be able to see the ratings for a given movie (e.g Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, etc.)

### Reviews
The user should be able to click through to an in-depth review about the movie (e.g NY Times Movie Review)

### Liking
The user should be able to "Like" a movie. A user should then be able to see all the movies they have "liked" for quicker access for ratings and review info. 

## Tools
This application could be built with a wide range of tools, but for the sake of this exercise, we should confine it to using PHP, Javascript, Laravel and React as our languages/frameworks of choice.
